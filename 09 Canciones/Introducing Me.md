G                       D
I, I'm good at wasting time
                        Em
I think lyrics need to rhyme
And you're not asking
          C
But I'm trying to grow a mustache
       G                          D
I eat cheese, but only on pizza, please
                    Em
And sometimes on a homemade quesadilla
  C
Otherwise it smells like feet to me

Am                                Bm
And I, I really like it when the moon looks like a toenail
       A                        C        D
And I love you when you say my nae-ae-ame

G
If you wanna know here it goes gonna tell you this
    D
The part of me that'll show if you're close
Gonna let you see
Em
everything
    C
But remember that you asked for it
    G
I'll try to do my best to impress
But it's easier
    D
to let you take a guess at the rest
But you wanna hear
    Em
what lives in my brain
    C
My heart, will you ask for it
    Am
for your perusing?
    Bm
At times confusing
C
slightly amusing
D
Introducing me

G
Doo doo, di di di di doo

La da la da la da la da,  da

  G                              D
I never trust a dog to watch my food
                               Em
And I like to use to the word dude
                   C
As a noun, or an adverb, or an adjective
          G                      D
And I've never really been into cars
                     Em
I like really cool guitars and superheroes
      C
And checks with lots of zeros on 'em
  Am                  Bm
I love the sound of violins
     A               C        D
And making someone smie-ie-ile

G
If you wanna know here it goes gonna tell you this
    D
The part of me that'll show if you're close
Gonna let you see
Em
everything
    C
But remember that you asked for it
    G
I'll try to do my best to impress
But it's easier
    D
to let you take a guess at the rest
But you wanna hear
    Em
what lives in my brain
    C
My heart, will you ask for it
    Am
for your perusing?
    Bm
At times confusing
C
Possibly amusing
D

Em                                    C
Well, you probably know more than you ever wanted to
       A                        C         D
So be careful when you ask next tie-ie-ime
